### Hi there 👋 Welcome to my Github page !
I am an <b>Electronics Engineer</b>, worked for Electronics manufacturing companies in the past and currently working in the Web development field. My repositories are based on my interests and likes. I get excited with new technologies related to Electronics🪫and low level programming in Computer Science 💻 and Mechanical Engineering 👷🏼‍♂️ I also completed online courses and read books on <b>Deep Learning</b>🧠 and looking forward to build a <b>Computer Vision System</b> using OpenCV and PyTorch C++ APIs

I have graduated from <b>CUNY CCNY</b> with M.E.(E.E.) I also have a strong will to pursue an Associate degree in <b>Mechanical Engineering</b> 🚜⚙️ and transfer to a 4 year engineering degree. You can find my machine parts 🔩 drawing examples in CAD repository

At this moment I am busy in building a complex mechanical system using NVIDIA GPU and Solar panels but won't be sharing any information on this Github as its confidential...🤠
