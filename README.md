### Hi there 👋 Welcome to my Github page !
I am an <b>Electronics Engineer</b> who worked for Electronics manufacturing companies in the past and currently working in the Software development field. My repositories are based on my interests and likes. I get excited with new technology when it comes to the topics related to Electronics🪫and low level programming in Computer Science 💻 and Mechanical Engineering 👷🏼‍♂️ I also completed online courses and read books on <b>Deep Learning</b>🧠 and looking forward to build a <b>Computer Vision System</b> using OpenCV and Pytorch C++ APIs

I have graduated from <b>CUNY CCNY</b> with M.E.(E.E.) I also have a strong will to pursue an Associate of Science degree in <b>Mechanical Engineering</b> 🚜⚙️ and transfer to a 4 year engineering degree. You can find machine 🔩 drawings in CAD repository

At this moment I am preparing to apply to <b>Georgia Tech</b> online M.S.(C.S) program specializing in <b>High Performance Computing Systems </b>
