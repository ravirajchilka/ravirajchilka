### Hi there 👋 Welcome to my Github page !
I am an <b>Electronics Engineer</b> who worked for Electronics manufacturing companies in the past and currently working in the Software development field. My repositories are based on my interests and likes. I get excited with new technology when it comes to the topics related to Electronics🪫and low level programming in Computer Science 💻 and Mechanical Engineering 👷🏼‍♂️ I also completed online courses and read books on <b>Deep Learning</b>🧠 and looking forward to build a <b>Computer Vision System</b> using OpenCV and Pytorch C++ APIs

I have graduated from <b>CUNY CCNY</b> with M.E.(E.E.) I also have a strong will to pursue an Associate of Science degree in <b>Mechanical Engineering</b> 🚜⚙️ and transfer to a 4 year engineering degree. You can find machine 🔩 drawings in CAD repository

At this moment I am preparing to apply to <b>Georgia Tech</b> M.S.(C.S) program specializing in <b>High Performance Computing Systems </b> 

Here is my 2 cents for aspiring engineers
1. Start learning programming with Javascript, it's an event-driven programming language. Events are similar to interrupts in Embedded Systems programming.
2. Learn C language. If you do not know C then don't call yourself a software engineer or programmer.
3. Learn Assembly x86 language. You don't have to know everything about Assembly but you should be aware of basics of registers, memories, pointers, data types, various type of operations.
4. Learn VHDL or Verilog. These are hardware description languages. Using these programming languages we can build integrated circuits in electronics. These programming languages are inherently parallel in nature, that means if you write 100 lines of code, all the lines would execute at the same time, not line by line as it happens in traditional programming languages. For this reason digital electronics systems(like FPGAs, ASICs) are faster than any sequential programmed hardwares(like microprocessors, microcontrollers, GPUs).
5. Learn CAD tools. There are many CAD softwares such as AutoCAD, Fusion360, SOLIDWORKS, Solid Edge etc. Pick any of these and start working on mechanical machine parts designs. This helps to understand geometry, trigonometry and improves thinking capabilities as you would be thinking in terms of 2D and 3D views. I would suggest to go little beyond CAD by learning Engineering Mechanics, Theory of Machines, Stength of Materials, Pneumatic control systems, Thermodynamics etc.
6. Learn Embedded Systems using ESP32, Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano or Arduino boards using C or C++. You can create cool projects with these boards. I would avoid using Arduino but if you feel more comfortable go for it.
7. Learn Deep Learning, read books, watch videos on Udemy, YouTube. High school level math is a prerequisite for it though. Build simple regression, image classification, object detection models using Pytorch C++ API. I would suggest building a small scale fully connected neural network using just C.

The above points may not align with your current learning goals but by learning these skill sets you can make yourself standout. I am not suggesting these points for career standpoint but for self development
